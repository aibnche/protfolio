				<div className="tagline">
					<span>A developer crafting digital magic with clean code and pixel-perfect interfaces</span>
				</div>
				
				<p>Currently honing my skills at <strong>42 School</strong> while building projects with the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and <strong>Next.js</strong>. I bring designs to life with <strong>CSS/Sass</strong> superpowers and a focus on seamless user experiences.</p>
				
				<p>My tech journey started at <strong>OFPPT</strong>, with a passion for problem-solving through code. Now I'm leveling up at <strong>42 School</strong>'s peer-driven learning environment â€“ surviving the infamous "piscine" and embracing the grind <span className="emoji">ðŸ’»</span></p>
				
				<p>I thrive where logic meets creativity. Whether it's architecting a full-stack app or tweaking animations until they <em>feel</em> just right, I love the process as much as the result.</p>
				
				<p>Let's connect! I'm always open to collaborating on wild ideas or debating React vs NextJs over coffee.</p>
